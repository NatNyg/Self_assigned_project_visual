## This is the repository for my self assigned project for my visual analytics portfolio

### Description of project 
This script performs Transfer Learning on a dataset consisting of images labelled "good guy" or "bad guy". This means that I am using a pretrained convolutional neural network (VGG16) for feature extraction on my image data. Instead of normalizing by flattening and turning the images into black and white, this process turns the images into dense vector representations, thereby retaining more of the original image.The goal of the project is to use this transfer learning for a classification problem on the good guy/bad guy data, enabling the model to predict whether a person on a given image is in fact a good or a bad guy.
